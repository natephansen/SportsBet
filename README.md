# Betting League (Grouplay)

A Django web app for running a friendly sports-betting league. Teams submit weekly picks (spreads, moneylines, totals, and player props) and a one-time set of futures picks that settle at season end. Standings are tracked in units, with transparent scoring, interactive charts and an admin workflow for settling results.

Built with Python 3.12 and Django 5.2.
